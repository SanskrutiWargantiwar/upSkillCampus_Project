# Traffic Flow Forecasting Using LSTM

This project focuses on predicting vehicle traffic flow at major city junctions using historical time-series data.
The model helps in planning traffic signal timings and reducing congestion in smart city systems.

## Project Steps:
- Cleaned and preprocessed traffic dataset
- Extracted time-based features (hour, day, weekend indicator)
- Applied Min-Max normalization
- Trained an LSTM model for time-series forecasting
- Generated predictions and saved them in `submission_lstm.csv`

## Files in Repository:
- `Traffic_Forecasting_Notebook.ipynb` → Main code implementation
- `submission_lstm.csv` → Model prediction output
- `Final_Report_Sanskruti.docx / .pdf` → Internship project report
- `Traffic_Forecasting_Presentation.pptx` → Presentation slides

## Future Improvements:
- Use real-time traffic data
- Include weather and event information
- Deploy as a dashboard for live monitoring
- Integrate with adaptive traffic signal systems
